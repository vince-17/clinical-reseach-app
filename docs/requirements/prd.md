# Comprehensive PRD Creation Prompt for Clinical Research Management System

## Context and Background

You are tasked with creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a comprehensive Clinical Research Management System. This system serves clinical research organizations, contract research organizations (CROs), and pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials. The healthcare industry context is critical - this involves human subjects research with strict regulatory oversight, patient safety considerations, and complex operational workflows.

## Industry Background and Constraints

### Regulatory Environment
- **FDA Regulations**: All clinical research must comply with 21 CFR Parts 50, 56, 312, and 812
- **Good Clinical Practice (GCP)**: International ethical and scientific quality standards
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Patient health information must be fully protected and encrypted
- **ICH Guidelines**: International harmonization standards for clinical trials
- **Audit Requirements**: Systems must maintain complete audit trails for regulatory inspections

### Clinical Research Ecosystem
- **Multi-site Trials**: Studies often span 10-100+ research sites globally
- **Study Phases**: Phase I (safety, 20-100 participants), Phase II (efficacy, 100-300), Phase III (large-scale, 1000-3000), Phase IV (post-market)
- **Study Personnel**: Principal Investigators (MDs), Sub-Investigators, Study Coordinators, Data Managers, Monitors
- **Patients/Subjects**: Volunteers who consent to participate in research studies
- **Sponsors**: Pharmaceutical companies or academic institutions funding the research
- **Regulatory Bodies**: FDA, EMA, and other national agencies overseeing trial conduct

### Operational Challenges
- **Protocol Complexity**: Clinical trial protocols are 200-500 page documents with precise visit schedules, procedures, and requirements
- **Visit Windows**: Specific timeframes for each visit (e.g., Day 1 ±3 days, Week 4 ±7 days)
- **Resource Coordination**: Multiple specialists, equipment, lab services needed per patient visit
- **Supply Chain**: Investigational drugs, medical devices, lab kits with temperature requirements and expiration dates
- **Documentation**: Every action must be documented with electronic signatures and timestamps

## Primary Problems to Address

### Problem 1: Patient Visit Scheduling Complexity

**Current State Pain Points:**
- **Manual Coordination**: Coordinators spend 8-12 hours weekly coordinating schedules via phone/email
- **Resource Conflicts**: Double-booking of doctors, exam rooms, or specialized equipment
- **Protocol Deviations**: Visits scheduled outside acceptable protocol windows (compliance risk)
- **Communication Gaps**: Patients receive conflicting information from different staff members
- **Last-minute Changes**: 25-30% of visits are rescheduled, causing protocol delays
- **Workload Imbalance**: Some coordinators manage 100+ patients while others handle 20
- **Compliance Tracking**: Manual tracking of visit windows leads to protocol deviations

**Stakeholders Affected:**
- **Study Coordinators**: Overwhelmed with manual scheduling tasks, prone to errors
- **Principal Investigators**: Limited visibility into patient scheduling and study progress
- **Patients**: Poor experience with scheduling conflicts and miscommunication
- **Site Managers**: Unable to optimize resource utilization and staff productivity
- **Sponsors**: Study delays and increased costs due to scheduling inefficiencies

### Problem 2: Inventory Management Challenges

**Current State Pain Points:**
- **Manual Tracking**: Excel spreadsheets and paper logs for investigational products
- **Stockouts**: 15-20% of sites experience stockouts causing study delays
- **Expiration Waste**: $50,000-200,000 annual waste per site due to expired products
- **Temperature Excursions**: Cold chain breaks without proper monitoring and documentation
- **Lot Tracking**: Difficulty tracking which patients received which drug lots (recall implications)
- **Dispensing Errors**: Manual processes lead to incorrect medication dispensing
- **Regulatory Documentation**: Hours spent preparing inventory reports for monitors and auditors
- **Ordering Delays**: 2-4 week lead times for emergency product shipments

**Stakeholders Affected:**
- **Pharmacy Staff**: Overwhelmed with manual inventory tracking and documentation
- **Study Coordinators**: Time-consuming inventory checks before each patient visit
- **Quality Assurance**: Difficulty maintaining regulatory compliance and audit readiness
- **Sponsors**: Product waste, study delays, and compliance risks
- **Patients**: Treatment delays due to inventory issues
